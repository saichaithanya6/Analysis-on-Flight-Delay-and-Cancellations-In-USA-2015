# Dataset
For the project, I would like to look into the Flight delays and cancellations in the United States . More specifically, the dataset presents flight data from all the domestic airlines in the year 2015. Some of the data includes flight performance(time delays or aheads), flight origins and destinations, flight identifications.

You can download the dataset by unzipping the folder which can be downloded here:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv).
The datasetâ€™s size is 592.41 MB and is last updated on 2015. The dataset contains data from over 5800k domestic flight trips completed.

## Datasetsource
The flight delay and cancellation data was collected and published by the DOT's Bureau of
Transportation Statistics. The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of
Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large
air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted
flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015
flight delays and cancellations.
Dataset has 40 columns of both numerical and categorical data representing
informations regarding flight origins, destinations, time, and location. Those attributes includes
airtime, distance, arrival time, cancellation reason, etc. I think with all that information, we can
generate a lot of interesting questions for analysis.

# Business Question 1:
In order to improve the operating efficiency at major airports, What are
some measurements that they could use? And based on the result from the busiest route in
USA in 2015, which airline performs the best and which airline performs the worst?
# Business Question 2:
During what time period, does the air route from Washington D.C. to New York sees the most
delays? What are the reason for delays? Advices that we can give to airlines to better improve
their service.
